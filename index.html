        <main>
            <p>I'm David, based in Derbyshire, UK, and I'm currently training to be a software developer. 
            With a strong passion for technology, I spend my time learning JavaScript and aim to master Python next. 
            Alongside my love for coding, I enjoy keeping fit and healthy, and I'm an avid football fan, cheering for Sheffield United.  
            I find joy in personal development and exploring futuristic inventions.</p>
        <p>
            My journey into coding started with a fascination for how software shapes our world. 
            Eager to create and innovate, I began learning JavaScript, drawn by its versatility and power in web development. 
            The satisfaction of solving problems and building applications has fueled my passion, and I'm excited to continue this path, diving into Python to expand my skill set. 
            Embracing challenges and continuous learning, I look forward to a future where I can contribute as a skilled software developer.
